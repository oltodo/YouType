  <text start="16.72" dur="2.696">Roughly 43,000 years ago,</text>
  <text start="19.44" dur="2.976">a young cave bear
died in the rolling hills</text>
  <text start="22.44" dur="3.376">on the northwest border
of modern day Slovenia.</text>
  <text start="25.84" dur="4.096">A thousand years later,
a mammoth died in southern Germany.</text>
  <text start="29.96" dur="3.296">A few centuries after that,
a griffon vulture also died</text>
  <text start="33.28" dur="1.2">in the same vicinity.</text>
  <text start="35.28" dur="4.136">And we know almost nothing
about how these animals met their deaths,</text>
  <text start="39.44" dur="4.056">but these different creatures
dispersed across both time and space</text>
  <text start="43.52" dur="3.176">did share one remarkable fate.</text>
  <text start="46.72" dur="3.456">After their deaths,
a bone from each of their skeletons</text>
  <text start="50.2" dur="2.696">was crafted by human hands</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="1.2">into a flute.</text>
  <text start="54.92" dur="1.456">Think about that for a second.</text>
  <text start="56.4" dur="2.656">Imagine you&amp;#39;re a caveman,
40,000 years ago.</text>
  <text start="59.08" dur="1.656">You&amp;#39;ve mastered fire.</text>
  <text start="60.76" dur="2.056">You&amp;#39;ve built simple tools for hunting.</text>
  <text start="62.84" dur="2.616">You&amp;#39;ve learned how to craft
garments from animal skins</text>
  <text start="65.48" dur="2.056">to keep yourself warm in the winter.</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="2.736">What would you choose to invent next?</text>
  <text start="70.32" dur="3.136">It seems preposterous
that you would invent the flute,</text>
  <text start="73.48" dur="3.816">a tool that created
useless vibrations in air molecules.</text>
  <text start="77.319" dur="3.001">But that is exactly
what our ancestors did.</text>
  <text start="81.2" dur="3.416">Now this turns out
to be surprisingly common</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="1.616">in the history of innovation.</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="1.936">Sometimes people invent things</text>
  <text start="88.24" dur="2.936">because they want to stay alive
or feed their children</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="2.136">or conquer the village next door.</text>
  <text start="93.36" dur="1.416">But just as often,</text>
  <text start="94.8" dur="1.896">new ideas come into the world</text>
  <text start="96.72" dur="2.04">simply because they&amp;#39;re fun.</text>
  <text start="99.52" dur="2.416">And here&amp;#39;s the really strange thing:</text>
  <text start="101.96" dur="3.256">many of those playful
but seemingly frivolous inventions</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="2.616">ended up sparking
momentous transformations</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="3.096">in science, in politics and society.</text>
  <text start="111" dur="3.936">Take what may be the most
important invention of modern times:</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="1.736">programmable computers.</text>
  <text start="116.72" dur="4.616">Now, the standard story is that computers
descend from military technology,</text>
  <text start="121.36" dur="2.856">since many of the early computers
were designed specifically</text>
  <text start="124.24" dur="3.456">to crack wartime codes
or calculate rocket trajectories.</text>
  <text start="127.72" dur="3.496">But in fact, the origins
of the modern computer</text>
  <text start="131.24" dur="1.656">are much more playful,</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="1.296">even musical,</text>
  <text start="134.24" dur="1.256">than you might imagine.</text>
  <text start="135.52" dur="1.256">The idea behind the flute,</text>
  <text start="136.8" dur="3.096">of just pushing air through tubes
to make a sound,</text>
  <text start="139.92" dur="2.896">was eventually modified
to create the first organ</text>
  <text start="142.84" dur="1.736">more than 2,000 years ago.</text>
  <text start="144.6" dur="3.296">Someone came up with the brilliant idea
of triggering sounds</text>
  <text start="147.92" dur="2.896">by pressing small levers with our fingers,</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="2.376">inventing the first musical keyboard.</text>
  <text start="153.24" dur="4.136">Now, keyboards evolved
from organs to clavichords to harpsichords</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="1.336">to the piano,</text>
  <text start="158.76" dur="2.656">until the middle of the 19th century,</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="2.776">when a bunch of inventors
finally hit on the idea</text>
  <text start="164.24" dur="3.896">of using a keyboard
to trigger not sounds but letters.</text>
  <text start="168.16" dur="2.296">In fact, the very first typewriter</text>
  <text start="170.48" dur="3.16">was originally called
&amp;quot;the writing harpsichord.&amp;quot;</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="3.816">Flutes and music led
to even more powerful breakthroughs.</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="1.736">About a thousand years ago,</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="2.216">at the height of the Islamic Renaissance,</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="2.336">three brothers in Baghdad
designed a device</text>
  <text start="185.64" dur="2.496">that was an automated organ.</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="2.88">They called it &amp;quot;the instrument
that plays itself.&amp;quot;</text>
  <text start="191.96" dur="3.136">Now, the instrument
was basically a giant music box.</text>
  <text start="195.12" dur="4.336">The organ could be trained to play
various songs by using instructions</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="3.2">encoded by placing pins
on a rotating cylinder.</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="2.616">And if you wanted the machine
to play a different song,</text>
  <text start="206.08" dur="2.96">you just swapped a new cylinder in
with a different code on it.</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="3.376">This instrument was the first of its kind.</text>
  <text start="213.24" dur="1.736">It was programmable.</text>
  <text start="215" dur="3.056">Now, conceptually,
this was a massive leap forward.</text>
  <text start="218.08" dur="3.416">The whole idea of hardware and software</text>
  <text start="221.52" dur="3.216">becomes thinkable for the first time
with this invention.</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="2.456">And that incredibly powerful concept</text>
  <text start="227.24" dur="3.176">didn&amp;#39;t come to us as an instrument
of war or of conquest,</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="1.696">or necessity at all.</text>
  <text start="232.16" dur="5.136">It came from the strange delight
of watching a machine play music.</text>
  <text start="237.32" dur="3.216">In fact, the idea of programmable machines</text>
  <text start="240.56" dur="4.656">was exclusively kept alive by music
for about 700 years.</text>
  <text start="245.24" dur="2.496">In the 1700s, music-making machines</text>
  <text start="247.76" dur="3.576">became the playthings
of the Parisian elite.</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="3.176">Showmen used the same coded cylinders</text>
  <text start="254.56" dur="3.936">to control the physical movements
of what were called automata,</text>
  <text start="258.52" dur="2.016">an early kind of robot.</text>
  <text start="260.56" dur="1.936">One of the most famous of those robots</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="3.376">was, you guessed it,
an automated flute player</text>
  <text start="265.92" dur="1.896">designed by a brilliant French inventor</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="1.285">named Jacques de Vaucanson.</text>
  <text start="270.279" dur="3.497">And as de Vaucanson
was designing his robot musician,</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="1.936">he had another idea.</text>
  <text start="275.76" dur="3.976">If you could program a machine
to make pleasing sounds,</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="4.64">why not program it to weave
delightful patterns of color out of cloth?</text>
  <text start="284.92" dur="4.256">Instead of using the pins of the cylinder
to represent musical notes,</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="3.096">they would represent
threads with different colors.</text>
  <text start="292.32" dur="2.496">If you wanted a new pattern
for your fabric,</text>
  <text start="294.84" dur="1.68">you just programmed a new cylinder.</text>
  <text start="297.2" dur="2.64">This was the first programmable loom.</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="4.176">Now, the cylinders were too expensive
and time-consuming to make,</text>
  <text start="304.76" dur="1.536">but a half century later,</text>
  <text start="306.32" dur="2.616">another French inventor named Jacquard</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="4.696">hit upon the brilliant idea
of using paper-punched cards</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="1.776">instead of metal cylinders.</text>
  <text start="315.48" dur="3.056">Paper turned out to be
much cheaper and more flexible</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="2.136">as a way of programming the device.</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="4.456">That punch card system inspired
Victorian inventor Charles Babbage</text>
  <text start="325.2" dur="2.496">to create his analytical engine,</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="2.616">the first true programmable computer</text>
  <text start="330.36" dur="1.336">ever designed.</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="2.696">And punch cards were used
by computer programmers</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="2.08">as late as the 1970s.</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="2.616">So ask yourself this question:</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="3.496">what really made
the modern computer possible?</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="4.016">Yes, the military involvement
is an important part of the story,</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="3.736">but inventing a computer
also required other building blocks:</text>
  <text start="351.12" dur="1.216">music boxes,</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="2.016">toy robot flute players,</text>
  <text start="354.4" dur="1.496">harpsichord keyboards,</text>
  <text start="355.92" dur="2.576">colorful patterns woven into fabric,</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="2.816">and that&amp;#39;s just a small part of the story.</text>
  <text start="361.36" dur="2.976">There&amp;#39;s a long list of world-changing
ideas and technologies</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="1.696">that came out of play:</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="1.976">public museums, rubber,</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="2.336">probability theory, the insurance business</text>
  <text start="370.44" dur="1.216">and many more.</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="2.72">Necessity isn&amp;#39;t always
the mother of invention.</text>
  <text start="375.08" dur="4.176">The playful state of mind
is fundamentally exploratory,</text>
  <text start="379.28" dur="2.96">seeking out new possibilities
in the world around us.</text>
  <text start="382.92" dur="3.496">And that seeking
is why so many experiences</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="3.016">that started with simple
delight and amusement</text>
  <text start="389.48" dur="2.76">eventually led us
to profound breakthroughs.</text>
  <text start="393.04" dur="4.216">Now, I think this has implications
for how we teach kids in school</text>
  <text start="397.28" dur="2.36">and how we encourage innovation
in our workspaces,</text>
  <text start="400.52" dur="3.056">but thinking about play
and delight this way</text>
  <text start="403.6" dur="3.536">also helps us detect what&amp;#39;s coming next.</text>
  <text start="407.16" dur="2.376">Think about it: if you were
sitting there in 1750</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="3.536">trying to figure out
the big changes coming to society</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="1.896">in the 19th, the 20th centuries,</text>
  <text start="415.04" dur="2.056">automated machines, computers,</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="1.936">artificial intelligence,</text>
  <text start="419.08" dur="1.816">a programmable flute</text>
  <text start="420.92" dur="2.176">entertaining the Parisian elite</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="3.8">would have been as powerful a clue
as anything else at the time.</text>
  <text start="427.84" dur="2.536">It seemed like an amusement at best,</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="2.736">not useful in any serious way,</text>
  <text start="433.16" dur="3.856">but it turned out to be
the beginning of a tech revolution</text>
  <text start="437.04" dur="1.856">that would change the world.</text>
  <text start="438.92" dur="1.856">You&amp;#39;ll find the future</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="2">wherever people are having the most fun.</text>
