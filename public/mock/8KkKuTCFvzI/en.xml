  <text start="12.76" dur="2.975">What keeps us healthy and happy</text>
  <text start="15.76" dur="1.56">as we go through life?</text>
  <text start="18.52" dur="2.496">If you were going to invest now</text>
  <text start="21.04" dur="2.056">in your future best self,</text>
  <text start="23.12" dur="2.96">where would you put your time
and your energy?</text>
  <text start="27.12" dur="2.416">There was a recent survey of millennials</text>
  <text start="29.56" dur="5.176">asking them what their
most important life goals were,</text>
  <text start="34.76" dur="2.016">and over 80 percent said</text>
  <text start="36.8" dur="4.136">that a major life goal for them
was to get rich.</text>
  <text start="40.96" dur="4.336">And another 50 percent
of those same young adults</text>
  <text start="45.32" dur="2.536">said that another major life goal</text>
  <text start="47.88" dur="1.84">was to become famous.</text>
  <text start="50.96" dur="1.216">(Laughter)</text>
  <text start="52.2" dur="6.656">And we&amp;#39;re constantly told
to lean in to work, to push harder</text>
  <text start="58.88" dur="2.056">and achieve more.</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="3.656">We&amp;#39;re given the impression that these
are the things that we need to go after</text>
  <text start="64.64" dur="1.816">in order to have a good life.</text>
  <text start="66.48" dur="2.216">Pictures of entire lives,</text>
  <text start="68.72" dur="5.216">of the choices that people make
and how those choices work out for them,</text>
  <text start="73.96" dur="2.88">those pictures
are almost impossible to get.</text>
  <text start="78.08" dur="3.056">Most of what we know about human life</text>
  <text start="81.16" dur="3.456">we know from asking people
to remember the past,</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="4.776">and as we know, hindsight
is anything but 20/20.</text>
  <text start="89.44" dur="3.696">We forget vast amounts
of what happens to us in life,</text>
  <text start="93.16" dur="2.88">and sometimes memory
is downright creative.</text>
  <text start="96.8" dur="4.376">But what if we could watch entire lives</text>
  <text start="101.2" dur="2.856">as they unfold through time?</text>
  <text start="104.08" dur="3.976">What if we could study people
from the time that they were teenagers</text>
  <text start="108.08" dur="2.736">all the way into old age</text>
  <text start="110.84" dur="3.36">to see what really keeps people
happy and healthy?</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="1.2">We did that.</text>
  <text start="117.64" dur="2.216">The Harvard Study of Adult Development</text>
  <text start="119.88" dur="4.76">may be the longest study
of adult life that&amp;#39;s ever been done.</text>
  <text start="125.72" dur="6.12">For 75 years, we&amp;#39;ve tracked
the lives of 724 men,</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="4.496">year after year, asking about their work,
their home lives, their health,</text>
  <text start="137.88" dur="4.376">and of course asking all along the way
without knowing how their life stories</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="1.44">were going to turn out.</text>
  <text start="145.28" dur="3.616">Studies like this are exceedingly rare.</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="4.056">Almost all projects of this kind
fall apart within a decade</text>
  <text start="153" dur="3.176">because too many people
drop out of the study,</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="2.896">or funding for the research dries up,</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="2.256">or the researchers get distracted,</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="4.08">or they die, and nobody moves the ball
further down the field.</text>
  <text start="166.28" dur="2.256">But through a combination of luck</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="3.696">and the persistence
of several generations of researchers,</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="1.56">this study has survived.</text>
  <text start="174.52" dur="4.496">About 60 of our original 724 men</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="1.296">are still alive,</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="2.176">still participating in the study,</text>
  <text start="182.56" dur="2.04">most of them in their 90s.</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="1.896">And we are now beginning to study</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="3.36">the more than 2,000 children of these men.</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="2.32">And I&amp;#39;m the fourth director of the study.</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="4.736">Since 1938, we&amp;#39;ve tracked the lives
of two groups of men.</text>
  <text start="200.16" dur="2.136">The first group started in the study</text>
  <text start="202.32" dur="2.696">when they were sophomores
at Harvard College.</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="2.816">They all finished college
during World War II,</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="2.44">and then most went off
to serve in the war.</text>
  <text start="211.28" dur="2.136">And the second group that we&amp;#39;ve followed</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="4.176">was a group of boys
from Boston&amp;#39;s poorest neighborhoods,</text>
  <text start="217.64" dur="2.016">boys who were chosen for the study</text>
  <text start="219.68" dur="3.336">specifically because they were
from some of the most troubled</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="1.856">and disadvantaged families</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="2.736">in the Boston of the 1930s.</text>
  <text start="227.68" dur="4.6">Most lived in tenements,
many without hot and cold running water.</text>
  <text start="234.52" dur="1.896">When they entered the study,</text>
  <text start="236.44" dur="2.936">all of these teenagers were interviewed.</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="2.216">They were given medical exams.</text>
  <text start="241.64" dur="3.536">We went to their homes
and we interviewed their parents.</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="2.376">And then these teenagers
grew up into adults</text>
  <text start="247.6" dur="2.416">who entered all walks of life.</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="6.096">They became factory workers and lawyers
and bricklayers and doctors,</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="2.36">one President of the United States.</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="4.24">Some developed alcoholism.
A few developed schizophrenia.</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="2.296">Some climbed the social ladder</text>
  <text start="267.64" dur="3.216">from the bottom
all the way to the very top,</text>
  <text start="270.88" dur="3.28">and some made that journey
in the opposite direction.</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="2.936">The founders of this study</text>
  <text start="278.48" dur="2.016">would never in their wildest dreams</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="4.536">have imagined that I would be
standing here today, 75 years later,</text>
  <text start="285.08" dur="3.08">telling you that
the study still continues.</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="3.616">Every two years, our patient
and dedicated research staff</text>
  <text start="292.92" dur="3.056">calls up our men
and asks them if we can send them</text>
  <text start="296" dur="3.12">yet one more set of questions
about their lives.</text>
  <text start="300.04" dur="3.576">Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,</text>
  <text start="303.64" dur="3.88">&amp;quot;Why do you keep wanting to study me?
My life just isn&amp;#39;t that interesting.&amp;quot;</text>
  <text start="308.6" dur="2.376">The Harvard men never ask that question.</text>
  <text start="311" dur="5.2">(Laughter)</text>
  <text start="320.92" dur="2.856">To get the clearest picture
of these lives,</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="2.936">we don&amp;#39;t just send them questionnaires.</text>
  <text start="326.76" dur="2.456">We interview them in their living rooms.</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="2.936">We get their medical records
from their doctors.</text>
  <text start="332.2" dur="2.496">We draw their blood, we scan their brains,</text>
  <text start="334.72" dur="1.696">we talk to their children.</text>
  <text start="336.44" dur="5.256">We videotape them talking with their wives
about their deepest concerns.</text>
  <text start="341.72" dur="3.536">And when, about a decade ago,
we finally asked the wives</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="2.376">if they would join us
as members of the study,</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="2.696">many of the women said,
&amp;quot;You know, it&amp;#39;s about time.&amp;quot;</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="1.056">(Laughter)</text>
  <text start="351.48" dur="1.696">So what have we learned?</text>
  <text start="353.2" dur="5.216">What are the lessons that come
from the tens of thousands of pages</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="3.056">of information that we&amp;#39;ve generated</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="1.2">on these lives?</text>
  <text start="363.72" dur="5.6">Well, the lessons aren&amp;#39;t about wealth
or fame or working harder and harder.</text>
  <text start="370.52" dur="6.296">The clearest message that we get
from this 75-year study is this:</text>
  <text start="376.84" dur="5.2">Good relationships keep us
happier and healthier. Period.</text>
  <text start="383" dur="3.816">We&amp;#39;ve learned three big lessons
about relationships.</text>
  <text start="386.84" dur="4.096">The first is that social connections
are really good for us,</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="2.496">and that loneliness kills.</text>
  <text start="393.48" dur="3.656">It turns out that people
who are more socially connected</text>
  <text start="397.16" dur="3.096">to family, to friends, to community,</text>
  <text start="400.28" dur="4.696">are happier, they&amp;#39;re physically healthier,
and they live longer</text>
  <text start="405" dur="3.376">than people who are less well connected.</text>
  <text start="408.4" dur="3.416">And the experience of loneliness
turns out to be toxic.</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="5.136">People who are more isolated
than they want to be from others</text>
  <text start="417" dur="3.216">find that they are less happy,</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="2.936">their health declines earlier in midlife,</text>
  <text start="423.2" dur="2.216">their brain functioning declines sooner</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="3.56">and they live shorter lives
than people who are not lonely.</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="3.216">And the sad fact
is that at any given time,</text>
  <text start="433.28" dur="4.6">more than one in five Americans
will report that they&amp;#39;re lonely.</text>
  <text start="439.04" dur="2.656">And we know that you
can be lonely in a crowd</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="2.656">and you can be lonely in a marriage,</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="2.136">so the second big lesson that we learned</text>
  <text start="446.56" dur="3.096">is that it&amp;#39;s not just
the number of friends you have,</text>
  <text start="449.68" dur="3.496">and it&amp;#39;s not whether or not
you&amp;#39;re in a committed relationship,</text>
  <text start="453.2" dur="4.64">but it&amp;#39;s the quality
of your close relationships that matters.</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="4.776">It turns out that living in the midst
of conflict is really bad for our health.</text>
  <text start="463.36" dur="3.976">High-conflict marriages, for example,
without much affection,</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="5.776">turn out to be very bad for our health,
perhaps worse than getting divorced.</text>
  <text start="473.16" dur="4.776">And living in the midst of good,
warm relationships is protective.</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="3.096">Once we had followed our men
all the way into their 80s,</text>
  <text start="481.08" dur="3.016">we wanted to look back at them at midlife</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="1.576">and to see if we could predict</text>
  <text start="485.72" dur="3.976">who was going to grow
into a happy, healthy octogenarian</text>
  <text start="489.72" dur="1.2">and who wasn&amp;#39;t.</text>
  <text start="491.68" dur="4.216">And when we gathered together
everything we knew about them</text>
  <text start="495.92" dur="1.36">at age 50,</text>
  <text start="498.08" dur="2.536">it wasn&amp;#39;t their middle age
cholesterol levels</text>
  <text start="500.64" dur="2.896">that predicted how they
were going to grow old.</text>
  <text start="503.56" dur="3.456">It was how satisfied they were
in their relationships.</text>
  <text start="507.04" dur="4.896">The people who were the most satisfied
in their relationships at age 50</text>
  <text start="511.96" dur="2.4">were the healthiest at age 80.</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="3.176">And good, close relationships
seem to buffer us</text>
  <text start="518.88" dur="2.76">from some of the slings and arrows
of getting old.</text>
  <text start="522.48" dur="3.976">Our most happily partnered men and women</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="2.055">reported, in their 80s,</text>
  <text start="528.559" dur="2.937">that on the days
when they had more physical pain,</text>
  <text start="531.52" dur="1.96">their mood stayed just as happy.</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="3.256">But the people who were
in unhappy relationships,</text>
  <text start="537.68" dur="2.936">on the days when they
reported more physical pain,</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="3.04">it was magnified by more emotional pain.</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="4.376">And the third big lesson that we learned
about relationships and our health</text>
  <text start="548.76" dur="3.256">is that good relationships
don&amp;#39;t just protect our bodies,</text>
  <text start="552.04" dur="1.48">they protect our brains.</text>
  <text start="554.44" dur="4.656">It turns out that being
in a securely attached relationship</text>
  <text start="559.12" dur="3.896">to another person in your 80s
is protective,</text>
  <text start="563.04" dur="1.976">that the people who are in relationships</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="4.136">where they really feel they can count
on the other person in times of need,</text>
  <text start="569.2" dur="3.696">those people&amp;#39;s memories
stay sharper longer.</text>
  <text start="572.92" dur="1.496">And the people in relationships</text>
  <text start="574.44" dur="3.136">where they feel they really
can&amp;#39;t count on the other one,</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="3.88">those are the people who experience
earlier memory decline.</text>
  <text start="582.52" dur="3.456">And those good relationships,
they don&amp;#39;t have to be smooth all the time.</text>
  <text start="586" dur="3.576">Some of our octogenarian couples
could bicker with each other</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="1.736">day in and day out,</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="3.176">but as long as they felt that they
could really count on the other</text>
  <text start="594.56" dur="1.816">when the going got tough,</text>
  <text start="596.4" dur="3.6">those arguments didn&amp;#39;t take a toll
on their memories.</text>
  <text start="601.6" dur="2.736">So this message,</text>
  <text start="604.36" dur="5.696">that good, close relationships
are good for our health and well-being,</text>
  <text start="610.08" dur="2.936">this is wisdom that&amp;#39;s as old as the hills.</text>
  <text start="613.04" dur="3.84">Why is this so hard to get
and so easy to ignore?</text>
  <text start="617.56" dur="1.456">Well, we&amp;#39;re human.</text>
  <text start="619.04" dur="2.816">What we&amp;#39;d really like is a quick fix,</text>
  <text start="621.88" dur="1.696">something we can get</text>
  <text start="623.6" dur="2.76">that&amp;#39;ll make our lives good
and keep them that way.</text>
  <text start="627.32" dur="3.336">Relationships are messy
and they&amp;#39;re complicated</text>
  <text start="630.68" dur="3.816">and the hard work of tending
to family and friends,</text>
  <text start="634.52" dur="2.656">it&amp;#39;s not sexy or glamorous.</text>
  <text start="637.2" dur="3.336">It&amp;#39;s also lifelong. It never ends.</text>
  <text start="640.56" dur="5.056">The people in our 75-year study
who were the happiest in retirement</text>
  <text start="645.64" dur="5.816">were the people who had actively worked
to replace workmates with new playmates.</text>
  <text start="651.48" dur="2.976">Just like the millennials
in that recent survey,</text>
  <text start="654.48" dur="3.616">many of our men when they
were starting out as young adults</text>
  <text start="658.12" dur="4.016">really believed that fame and wealth
and high achievement</text>
  <text start="662.16" dur="3.936">were what they needed to go after
to have a good life.</text>
  <text start="666.12" dur="4.176">But over and over, over these 75 years,
our study has shown</text>
  <text start="670.32" dur="5.656">that the people who fared the best were
the people who leaned in to relationships,</text>
  <text start="676" dur="3.24">with family, with friends, with community.</text>
  <text start="681.08" dur="1.976">So what about you?</text>
  <text start="683.08" dur="3.76">Let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re 25,
or you&amp;#39;re 40, or you&amp;#39;re 60.</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="2.96">What might leaning in
to relationships even look like?</text>
  <text start="691.76" dur="3.12">Well, the possibilities
are practically endless.</text>
  <text start="695.6" dur="6.096">It might be something as simple
as replacing screen time with people time</text>
  <text start="701.72" dur="4.456">or livening up a stale relationship
by doing something new together,</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="2.2">long walks or date nights,</text>
  <text start="709.36" dur="4.856">or reaching out to that family member
who you haven&amp;#39;t spoken to in years,</text>
  <text start="714.24" dur="3.496">because those all-too-common family feuds</text>
  <text start="717.76" dur="2.216">take a terrible toll</text>
  <text start="720" dur="2.08">on the people who hold the grudges.</text>
  <text start="724" dur="3.92">I&amp;#39;d like to close with a quote
from Mark Twain.</text>
  <text start="729.28" dur="2.376">More than a century ago,</text>
  <text start="731.68" dur="2.616">he was looking back on his life,</text>
  <text start="734.32" dur="1.28">and he wrote this:</text>
  <text start="736.84" dur="3.696">&amp;quot;There isn&amp;#39;t time, so brief is life,</text>
  <text start="740.56" dur="5.16">for bickerings, apologies,
heartburnings, callings to account.</text>
  <text start="746.72" dur="2.816">There is only time for loving,</text>
  <text start="749.56" dur="3.72">and but an instant,
so to speak, for that.&amp;quot;</text>
  <text start="754.76" dur="4.376">The good life is built
with good relationships.</text>
  <text start="759.16" dur="1.216">Thank you.</text>
  <text start="760.4" dur="5.44">(Applause)</text>
